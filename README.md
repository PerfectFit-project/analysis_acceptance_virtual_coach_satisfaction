## Excel sheets explanations
Aside from each user having a 'rand_ID' which can be use as an identifier in the original data set as well, which is referneced in the thesis paper from which this repo has been referenced from, each user also has a a 'sequentialID' which is from 1 to 500. It was assigned based on ascending order of 'rand_ID'. 'sequentialID' used in these sheet are for the sake of being able to easily refer to specific users in the thesis paper.

The following points explain what each of the sheets contain:

* 'first coder assignments' : this contains the codes assigned to each response by the first coder in the first iteration of developing codes, therefore, more codes exist here than in the final set of codes
* 'explaining numbers in coding' : this explains what the numbers (-1, 1 or blank) used in coding scheme represent
* 'second coder assignments' : this contains the codes assigned to each response by the second coder after they had been trained, before finalising the scheme or holding discussions
* 'subst. for calc. cohen's kappa' : this illustrates how the numbers used in the coding scheme were replaced with a different encoding for the sake of being able to sum up easier where agreements and disagreements occured in order to calculate cohen's kappa of a 3x3 format
* 'explanation to prev. sheet' : this explains what this new encoding used in the previous sheet represent and also contains a reference to the online tool used to calculate cohen's kappa
* 'final coding and themes' : this contains the final codes assigned to each of the responses
